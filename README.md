# Hackin
A pair programming app powered by flask, firebase and firepad. 

Allows multiple programmers to work on the same code file in real time. 

You can try it out <a href="https://hackin.herokuapp.com">here</a> 


Under the hood is <a href="https://firepad.io">Firepad</a>, which provides
a basic editor that you can customize to your taste. 

## How it works
<ol>
<li>Visit the app <a href="https://hackin.herokuapp.com">here</a> </li>
<li>Sign up (for initial users only)</li>
<li>Click on create Hack to create a new programming session</li>
<li>The page will redirect to an editor and you can start programming</li>
<li>To invite someone to the editing session, you can simply send them
the url of the session or if they are signed up users, you can click the 
invite button alongside their name and they will get an email with the url.</li>
<ol>

## What doesn't work
<ul>
	<li>Deleting sessions is still not working as expected</li>
	<li>Emails for sessions invites are sent out more than once</li>
	<li>Chatting functionality is still not vailable</li>
</ul>
